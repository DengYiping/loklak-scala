loklak is a p2p twitter crawler written on java. However, when I open their source code, it really surprise me.
Scala is better than java in some perspective, especially when developing a big project.
This software is currently under development. It could be used as a twitter search wrapper right now. Right now the software is under MIT license. Further changes in license is possible.
